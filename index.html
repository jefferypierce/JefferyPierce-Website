        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jeffery Pierce. I’m 19 years old with a major in Pre-Business at the University of California, Riverside. I graduated from Fountain Valley High School in Orange County, California in 2022 and was awarded with AP Scholar with Honors and FVHS Scholar with Distinction. I began working early as a tennis tournament line judge for children for my old tennis coach on the weekends. The pay wasn’t very good but it taught me how to converse with other people in high pressure situations and mediate disputes between the parents and players. I had to make the best decision possible that was fair but also had to explain to both parties why I had made the decision even if it didn’t go their way. 
I then coached high school tennis over the summer for the FVHS tennis team. I had taught students ranging from academy players to complete beginners so it taught me a lot in regards to educating others as well as being clear, concise, and patient. I had to maintain many kids with differing levels of skills and things to work on and I had to be able to form relationships with every single one of them to create a positive learning experience. I wanted for them to fall in love with the sport in the same way I had as opposed to just playing it because they were told to. It was during this time that I also received my CPR and First Aid Certification.  Over this past summer I also began working on a tech startup called Sixturns as a Sales and Marketing Coordinator. It was an extremely good environment to grow in as it taught me plenty of things in regards to working together as a team in a professional setting and the struggles of entrepreneurship. I had to constantly think of new marketing strategies to best propel the company to the most people possible as well as monitor consumer feedback and how well our strategies were panning out. I examined the needs, wants, and actions behind consumers and discussed with the team the best course of action to create a product that would meet those needs. It has gone through many iterations as we test out ideas but it’s something I continue to enjoy working on. 
Currently I’m working as a fragrance sales associate at Nordstrom. Fragrances have always been a significant hobby of mine and I enjoy the process of selling them to customers and convincing them to purchase a product they otherwise never would have thought to. It’s still early on in my job but I’ve learned what it's like to work in a retail environment and improved my selling skills through it. I’m also fluent in Mandarin Chinese as I was born in Beijing, China and slightly conversational Spanish after taking it in high school. I enjoy watching films, playing video games, golfing, and spending time with my loved ones in my free time. I currently still live in Orange County and commute back and forth to Riverside.
